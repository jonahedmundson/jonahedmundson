            <h3> Valleyview Way (2024) </h3>
            <pre>
On the tenth of November
Tempestuous day
Began my misfortunes 
On Valleyview Way 

For five years I have traveled 
Without worry or strife
Who knew it'd be snow 
That would ruin my life 

There's this girl I've been courting 
So lovely and fair 
So I planned a nice dinner
And on our way there 

We took a sharp corner 
And slid in the ditch 
My tyres were still summers 
Isn't that rich? 

Pray please push my dear lassie 
Please push if you can 
Please push a bit harder 
This wasn't my plan! 

Please push my dear lassie 
Please try one more time 
Put your back right into it
Or we'll be here all night 

She really gave it her all 
She gave it her best
But my car was still stuck 
And I was still stressed 

So I yell "One more time,
It's gotta work soon!" 
Oh today of all days! 
I wish it were June! 

That's when I realized 
I'd gone way off-track 
'Cuz I was up front 
While she pushed out back!

I was the man 
But I failed that day!
I should have pushed! 
And she should've stayed! 

Pray please push my dear lassie
Please push if you can
Please push a bit harder
This wasn't my plan!

Please push my dear lassie
Please try one more time
Put your back right into it
Or we'll be here all night 

So please take my advice 
If you've got a date 
Treat her like a lady 
And you'll do just great 

But if extra precautions 
I could offer today 
I'd tell you don't take her 
Down Valleyview Way!

            <h3> The wat'ry tides keep time (2024) </h3>
            <p>
            The wat'ry tides keep time from dawn to dusk, <br>
            Celestial Mother fetter'd, treads her course. <br>
            Command not I, from will, this mortal husk? <br>
            Naive pretension lost, beyond recourse.  <br>
            <br>
            Soon sullied, dragged, was I: Weird's prisoner. <br> 
            Yet thinking, feeling, here, alive to see, <br>
            with spirits bright and demons to confer, <br>
            the choice my own to grant or disagree. <br>
            <br> 
            The Fates do make the blame facile to shirk, <br>
            men oft incite misdeed and sloth with talk; <br>
            instead commit thyself unto good works, <br>
            in which thy God ordained for you to walk. <br> 
            <br>
            To live in death or die in life, do we <br> 
            uniquely govern choice eternally.

          <h3> Conviction (2024) </h3>
          <p>
          Unseason'd minds green, <br>
          Earth's spring grasses strain <br>
          to reach above th' pallid moon, <br>
          to grasp high heaven's purities, <br>
          yet November's frost <br> 
          withers the attempt. <br>
          Through some sun's cycle <br>
          he is refreshed, <br>
          along with the weeds <br>
          and the thicket. <br>
          Th' intended purpose <br>
          is lost amongst the brambles. <br> 
          It is usually the case <br> 
          that a handful of years <br>
          is enough to temper such <br> 
          grasses into a garden.

          <p>
          soft i lay in Eden's fair grasses <br>
          tall and bowed to lull to sleep. <br>
          aethereal breeze brings summer's air <br>
          warm caresses longings deep.   <br>
	  <br> 
          But what? How's this? <br>
          'Tis not the moon that lights this scene, <br>
          but power emanated from my screen, <br>
	  not warm summer air <br>
         but furnace draft that heats this lair <br>
         neither Eden's grasses my bassinet, <br>
         but sheets moth-eaten; and yet <br> 
	 deceived, for a moment, was i <br> 
	 to my true condition. <br>
	 That fleeting world, however, <br> 
	 was enough to keep me there forever.

            <h3> the crag (2022) </h3>
            <p>
            there's a crag where i live <br>
            it starts right outside my door <br>
            and i fall in every day <br>
             <br>
            it is deep  <br>
            and dark and dirty down there <br>
            and i can never seem to find my way out <br>
            until it is time to sleep again <br>
             <br>
            when i step outside in the morning <br>
            the sun pierces my back <br>
            and warms my heart <br>
            but only briefly <br>
             <br>
            as i step out  <br>
            into the world <br>
            i trip and fall into that crag <br>
            that crag that starts right outside my door <br>
             <br>
            there is no sun down here <br>
            no light at all <br>
            and my mind collects the filth <br>
            and the dirt that lines the walls <br>
             <br>
            my only comfort is that everyone else seems to fall into the crag too <br>
            whenever they walk outside their own houses in the morning <br>
            so we all fumble in the darkness together <br>
            collecting filth <br>
             <br>
            how nice, i thought to myself one morning <br>
            would it be to have some light in the crag? <br>
            to bring down a piece of that blinding sun? <br>
            so that people could see the dirt on the walls and their hands and their minds <br>
             <br>
            i stay up late <br>
            thinking of a way  <br>
            to bring down a piece of the sun <br>
            into that crag right outside our doors <br>
             <br>
            ... <br>
             <br>
            i never could quite figure it out <br>
            how to bring a piece of the sun down into the crag <br>
            the only solution i found <br>
            was to keep myself from falling in <br>
             <br>
            if i look down, <br>
            i can see everyone else  <br>
            down in the crag <br>
            shuffling in the darkness <br>
             <br>
            i want to help them <br>
            to show them the sun <br>
            but i don't have the strength <br>
             <br>
             <br>
            please give me the strength <br>

            <h3> meaning of me (2022) </h3>
            <p>
            i met a man, once <br>
            who knew the meaning of the moon <br>
            who knew the meaning of the stars and the heavens <br>
            the meaning of the earth <br>
            the meaning of me <br>
             <br>
            Adam, the man said <br>
            take up your shovel, and dig into the bowels of the earth <br>
            to that place where men melt and mysteries unveil <br>
            Adam, he said <br>
            prepare your sacrifice <br>
            what do you mean? i cried out to the man <br>
            to that man who knew the meaning of the moon <br>
            what shall i prepare? how shall i prepare it? <br>
            but the man would not answer. <br>
            Dig, he said, and was gone <br>
             <br>
             <br>
             <br>
            i get lonely, sometimes, in this hole that i dug <br>
            it is dark, and i cannot tell if i am digging in the right places <br>
            it is not easy work <br>
            many times i thought about leaving this hole <br>
            this hole that i dug <br>
            to go back <br>
            back to where i was living before <br>
            but i think it is getting hotter <br>
            the man visits me, every once and a while <br>
            that man who knew the meaning of the stars and the heavens <br>
            upon each visit, i ask him again, how i should prepare my special sacrifice <br>
            but each time i ask, all that he says <br>
            is Dig <br>
             <br>
            some time later <br>
            how much later i cannot say <br>
            i reached that place where men melt and mysteries are unveiled <br>
            and the man came to me, and said <br>
            it is time <br>
            Time for what? i ask the man <br>
            How am I to know what to do? <br>
            What is the sacrifice? <br>
            You, the man says to me. You. <br>
            i melt away, <br>
            into bleak oblivion. <br>
            into dust. <br>
            into nothing. <br>
            I am gone. <br>
            Gone <br>
            but i am also right here. <br>
            and i always will be <br>
            Always here; never there nor then <br>
            always here. <br>
             <br>
            i did go back, eventually. <br>
            back to that place where i was before. <br>
            but things are different around here now. <br>
            i am gone. <br>
            melted into the bowels of the earth. <br>
            gone. <br>
            But I am also right here, <br>
            and now I know the meaning of me.

            <h3> the trail (2022) </h3>
            <p>
            the trail was right there. but you were too smart for that, too good. you know the way. you think. <br>
            you can hop logs, push past bushes. you can climb rocks. you think. <br>
             <br>
            you left the trail a long time ago. it doesn't bother you. too much anymore, anyway. <br>
            you got lost a long time ago. it doesnt bother you. you think. <br>
            you take another blind step forward, into the forest, into the dark. you can do this. you think. <br> 
            but you can't. the rocks begin to crack. the trees shake and fall. the lake boils. the bushes burn. you brought yourself here. you found this place. all on your own. <br>
            you long for shelter. but there is nowhere to go. <br>
            you long for your home, for your bed, for your friends. but there is nowhere to go. nowhere to hide. nowhere to feel safe. nowhere to run. you found this place. all on your own. you hopped the logs, you pushed past the bushes, you climbed the rocks. you left the trail. <br>
            this is your home now, next to the cracking rocks and falling trees and boiling lake. this is your home, next to the burning bushes. <br>
            this is your hell, and you brought yourself here. <br>
            you left the trail. <br>
             <br>
            maybe its not so bad, you say. next to the boiling lake and the burning bushes. <br>
            I like it here, you say. a small part of you knows that isn't true, but you keep smiling anyways. <br>
            I like it here, you say again, louder. you manage to convince yourself, at least for the moment. but that small part of you remains. <br>
            so stubborn. it never leaves you, even though you wish it would. you've done everything you can to make a home of this place. this place by the boiling lake. <br>
            you sit and watch time as it passes. you forgot about the trail a long time ago. <br>
            but that small part of you twitches and kicks. it reminds you of that time long ago, of that trail you used to walk on. <br>
            what would it be like, you dream to yourself, to walk on that trail again? to leave the home that you made by the burning bushes? <br>
            you feel compelled to act, to find the trail, to walk it once more. <br>
            but you cant. you got lost a long time ago. <br>
            you left the trail. <br>
             <br>
             <br>
            do not be afraid. <br>
            gods blessing is given to you also, and you too shall drink from the cup and eat of the bread. <br>
            come now, and be glad, for the time has come. <br>
            the trail is not lost, for all that seek it will find it once more. <br>
            you left the trail, but you found it again.

            <h3> mind maze (2019) </h3>
            <p>
            mazes can be fun <br>
            but not that fun <br>
            you build this maze for yourself <br>
            but you got lost for a bit too long this time <br>
            late for dinner, moms worried <br>
             <br>
            lost in your maze <br>
            your very own maze <br>
            that you built for yourself <br>
            that you built for your mind <br>
             <br>
            laying in bed <br>
            just building your maze <br>
            if only you knew <br>
            what trouble it made <br>
             <br>
            lost again <br>
            wait to be found <br>
            trapped in your maze <br>
            trapped in your mind <br>
             <br>
            get out! <br>
            you think <br>
            but you cant <br>
            i dont think <br>
             <br>
            you built this maze <br>
            you built it for you <br>
            when it comes from inside <br>
            you cant defend against it <br>
             <br>
            ---- <br>
             <br>
            your maze is your home <br>
            your very own new home <br>
            that you built for yourself <br>
            all by yourself <br>
             <br>
            you spend all this time <br>
            thinking alone <br>
            trapped in your maze <br>
            anxiety maze <br>
             <br>
            maze of melancholy <br>
            this wasnt your aim <br>
            yours is the blame <br>
            yours alone is the blame <br>
             <br>
            you try to forget <br>
            you to to escape <br>
            but your mind maze <br>
            is your new home forever

            <h3> stuck in the stairwell (2019) </h3>
            <p>
            up or down <br>
            i cannot decide <br>
            i am stuck in the stairwell <br>
             <br>
            dad called me up for dinner <br>
            but everyone else is still downstairs <br>
            playing cards <br>
             <br>
            hunger pulls me higher <br>
            but i just cant force myself <br>
            to fold <br>
             <br>
            the din from the basement <br>
            reminds me of home <br>
            but the light from above <br>
            bids me beyond <br>
             <br>
            what is more beautiful? <br>
            what is more honourable? <br>
            to remain and create <br>
            or to brave that eastern temple? <br>
             <br>
            body and soul <br>
            i am divided

            <p>
            sad eyes <br>
            feign face <br>
            disappointment realized  <br>
            reciprocal rage <br>

             <br>
            it's easy to move <br>
            but hard to defend <br>
